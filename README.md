# 🧬 Graph Persona: Genesis Phase  
## The Identity Anchor for the Agentic SAP Economy  
### A Midnight-powered Gateway for the Legeon Reputation Graph

---

## 🧭 Project Status: Phase 1 (Initial Build)

Legeon is currently in the **Genesis Build Phase**.

Following the strategic pivot from the Catalyst proposal, we are actively developing the **Graph Persona** — a self-sovereign, privacy-preserving identity asset for SAP professionals globally.

### 🔧 Active Development Focus

- Next.js 14 Frontend  
- Midnight Selective-Disclosure Schema Design  
- Sovereign Activation Flow  

No legacy Catalyst constraints apply.  
This is the foundational build for the Legeon ecosystem.

📄 See detailed progress: `docs/PHASE_1_GENESIS_PROGRESS.md`

# 🌐 Overview

The **Graph Persona** is a decentralized identity framework designed to disrupt traditional staffing models.

It demonstrates how:

- 🔐 Encrypted profile attributes  
- 🧾 Selective disclosure  
- 🧠 Zero-knowledge proofs  

Enable enterprise-safe decentralized consulting on Midnight — without exposing sensitive consultant or enterprise data.

### This project supports Legeon’s:

#### 🛡 Sovereign Identity  
Private, encrypted professional personas.

#### 📊 Verifiable Reputation  
Mapping outcomes to the Legeon Reputation Graph.

#### 🤖 Agentic Integration  
Identity anchors for SAP AI Orchestration.

# 📘 Current Status

**Genesis Build Phase — Active Development**

This repository contains:

- Next.js 14 frontend  
- Architectural schemas  
- Identity logic scaffolding  

We are transitioning from documentation into the functional build of the **Sovereign Activation Flow**.

---

# 🔑 What the Graph Persona Enables

Consultants can:

- Create encrypted profile attributes (SAP P2P, Joule, BTP expertise)
- Upload credentials securely off-chain
- Generate selective disclosure proofs (e.g., specific project experience)
- Mint a privacy-safe `ProfileNFT` (no personal data stored on-chain)
- Access early governance privately via ZK-validated eligibility

---

## 🧱 Core Design Principle

> **100% of PII remains off-chain.**

On-chain logic:
- Validates proofs  
- Issues certificates  
- Updates encrypted reputation counters  

Without revealing underlying data.

---

# 🏗 Architecture (High-Level)

## 1️⃣ Enterprise Systems (SAP / Fieldglass / Ariba / HRIS)

- All operational & personal data remains off-chain  
- Governed by enterprise security controls  

## 2️⃣ Legeon Vault (Private, Encrypted Off-Chain Storage)

Generates:
- Hashes & commitments  
- Encrypted attributes  
- Zero-knowledge proofs  

Produces proof artifacts for:
- Profile  
- Assignment  
- Timesheet  
- Invoice  

## 3️⃣ Midnight Confidential L1

Validates proofs privately and issues:

- Profile certificates (Sovereign Activation)  
- Assignment / timesheet / invoice certificates  
- Encrypted reputation counters  
- Governance eligibility logic  

## 4️⃣ Cardano Public L1

Stores only minimal metadata:

- Governance summaries  
- Token actions  

✅ No enterprise or consultant PII is stored on Cardano.

📊 See `/diagrams` for architecture visuals.

# 📁 Repository Structure

/frontend → Next.js 14 Sovereign Activation Wizard (Active)
/logic → Midnight Compact scripts & ZK-proof schemas (In Design)
/docs → Project Manifest, Brand Guidelines, Technical Specs
/diagrams → Reputation Graph & Architecture flows

---

# 🖥 Frontend Notes

Built with **Next.js 14**.

Planned integrations:

- CIP-30 wallet connection (Lace / Midnight compatible wallets)
- Backend API isolation for sensitive operations
- No direct access to raw credentials or ZK proofs from frontend

All sensitive cryptographic operations occur server-side.
