# 📘 Phase 1 Progress Update: Genesis Build Phase  
## Graph Persona: Genesis Phase — Identity Anchor for the Agentic SAP Economy

---

# 🎯 Purpose

This document provides a transparent progress update for the **Genesis Build Phase**.

Following the pivot from the initial proposal, Legeon is now independently developing the **Graph Persona infrastructure** to support the first 40 Genesis Innovators.

Phase 1 focuses on:

- Foundational identity architecture  
- Sovereign Activation user experience  
- Privacy-first reputation modeling  

---

# 🧭 What the Genesis Build Phase Means

Phase 1 is currently focused on the following pillars:

## 1️⃣ Sovereign Activation UX

- Next.js 14 frontend scaffolding  
- 6-step initialization wizard  
- Persona-first onboarding architecture  

## 2️⃣ Reputation Domain Modeling

- Defining nodes and edges for the Legeon Reputation Graph  
- Converting static CV attributes into verifiable graph entities  
- Establishing encrypted relationship logic  

## 3️⃣ Privacy Schemas

- Designing Midnight selective-disclosure interfaces  
- Structuring SAP credential verification logic  
- Zero-knowledge proof boundaries  

---

# 🧱 Phase 1 Development Boundary

The scope of this phase includes:

- Implementation of the Graph Persona as a self-sovereign professional asset  
- Migration from a **"DApp-first"** approach to a **"Persona-first"** architecture  
- Alignment with the Agentic SAP Economy (Joule / BTP integration readiness)  

This phase does **not** include enterprise workflow deployment.
